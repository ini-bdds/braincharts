Brain Growth Charts
===================

This package provides a resource for modeling and analyzing brain growth
patterns.  This is designed to reproduce the results of the associated paper,
which is currently under review.  You can reproduce the results of the paper by executing the script 'bin/run.sh'.  This includes steps for:

  * Creating a brain morphometric database
  * Estimating statiscal models relating age to imaging metrics
  * Plotting models for individual brain areas and imaging metrics
  * Estimating percentiles scores for individual subjects

Requirements:

  * R 3.3.3 or later
  * GAMLSS, available by running install_packages("gamlss")
